# hyperliquid-trader-tracker

## Fork direction: agent-operable expert ensemble

This is the upstream-tracked KonScanner infrastructure fork for a user-curated trader ensemble. The existing Rust tracker remains the observation foundation; a separate Python engine is planned for normalization, correlation, consensus, and account-aware advice.

**Current versus planned:** [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md) identifies inspected capabilities and gaps. The durable event interface, expert engine, and `copytrade` agent commands are design targets, not implemented features at the baseline. No real trade execution is authorized by this project plan.

**Start here:** [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) routes agent work; [CONTEXT-MAP.md](CONTEXT-MAP.md) maps ownership; [docs/SYSTEM.md](docs/SYSTEM.md) describes the complete operating model; [plan.md](plan.md) gives dependency-aware implementation slices and acceptance gates.

The upstream documentation below describes inherited behavior. Its capacity statements are not a load qualification of this fork, and its memory-only storage design will change only through the documented durability work.

## Inherited tracker

A real-time **Hyperliquid wallet tracker / whale watcher** as a **multi-tenant Telegram bot**,
written in **Rust**: anyone can message it, follow any wallet trading perps on
[Hyperliquid](https://hyperliquid.xyz), and get a DM the moment that wallet opens, scales into,
reduces, or closes a position — with entry, size, notional, leverage, realized/unrealized PnL
and ROI. Useful for copy trading, whale watching, and monitoring your own accounts, all over the
**public `trades` firehose**.

- **No auth, no scraping.** Uses only Hyperliquid's sanctioned public API
  (`wss://api.hyperliquid.xyz/ws` + `POST /info`). See [docs/hyperliquid-api-map.md](docs/hyperliquid-api-map.md).
- **Scales to 1k+ wallets** on one connection — the `trades` feed carries both counterparties,
  so one market-data subscription serves every subscriber by filtering.
- **Multi-tenant.** Each subscriber keeps their own labelled watchlist; a wallet's activity fans
  out to every subscriber following it, in their own chat with their own label.
- **Stores nothing but the watchlists.** Positions live in memory and are rebuilt from the chain
  (`clearinghouseState`) on every start; the SQLite `tracker.db` holds only `(chat_id, address, label)`.

Inherited design + rationale: [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md). Current fork target: [docs/SYSTEM.md](docs/SYSTEM.md).

## How it works

```
trades firehose ─► resolve_deltas (users:[buyer,seller] filter) ─► apply_fill state machine
                                                                   └─► open/add/reduce/close ─► Telegram push
clearinghouseState ─► silent seed (cold-start correctness) + leverage ┘
```

The **cold-start guarantee**: before a wallet is admitted to the live filter, its current
on-chain positions are seeded silently, so an add on a position opened *before* the tracker
started is correctly reported as *"Added to position"*, never a false *"Started trade"*.

## Notifications — one card per position, edited in place

The bot never sends a message per fill. Each `(wallet, coin)` position gets **one message — a
"TAPE" card — that is edited in place** through the whole lifecycle: open → add → reduce →
close. Telegram edits are silent, so you get **one ping when the trade opens** and the card then
quietly morphs until it ends as the completed round-trip. No spam — and scrolling back shows
each position's final state, not a trail of stale fills.

Cards are terminal-style grids: the same fixed slots across every event, in a monospace block,
so the numbers a copy-trader acts on always sit in the same place. The trader name in the header
is a **link to the wallet's explorer page** (the address is one tap away — no noisy raw-address
line), and the meta line carries a **TX** explorer link and the fill time. A fresh open:

```
🟢 Whale-1 · BTC LONG 10x
ENTRY    $63,120
SIZE     2.5 BTC
NOTIONAL $157.8k
🔗 TX · 🕒 12:00 UTC
```

…becomes, via silent edits, the *same message* once the wallet closes:

```
🔴 Whale-1 · BTC LONG 10x
SIZE     2 BTC
ENTRY    $63,120
EXIT     $64,500
NET P/L  +$2,760
ROI      +21.9%
HELD     3h12m
🔗 TX · 🕒 15:12 UTC
```

In between, an add shows the fill, the % it grew the position, the new blended entry and the
live uPnL (`ADDED +1 BTC  +50%` / `ENTRY $62,800` / `uPNL +$960`); a reduce shows the booked
PnL, the ROI on the reduced slice, and what's left (`REDUCED -0.5 BTC  -20%` /
`REALIZED +$440` / `ROI +14.7%` / `SIZE 2 left`). `ROI` is the leveraged return on margin,
shown when leverage is known.

Every live card carries a **🔄 Update P&L** button: tapping it re-reads the wallet's on-chain
state and edits the card into a live snapshot — current `MARK`, fresh `uPNL` + ROI, and the
liquidation price with its distance from the mark (`LIQ $57,180  -10.7%`).

Set `TRACKER_NOTIFY_REDUCE_CLOSE=false` to suppress *new* reduce/close pings (relevant after a
restart, when there's no live card left to edit) — an existing card is always edited silently,
so it never goes stale.

## Credentials — what you need and how to get it

**One credential: a Telegram bot token.** It cannot be generated by code — Telegram issues it
via **@BotFather**:

1. Open Telegram, message **@BotFather**, send `/newbot`.
2. Choose a display name, then a username ending in `bot`.
3. BotFather replies with a token like `123456789:AA...` — copy it.

Put it in a `.env` at the repo root (loaded via `load_dotenv()`), or export it:

```dotenv
# .env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:AA...
```

Verify the token works (and optionally see chat ids that have messaged the bot):

```bash
cargo run --bin hl-tracker-telegram-setup   # reads TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN from .env
```

That's it — there is **no chat id to configure**. This is a public bot: each subscriber's chat is
captured automatically when they message it. (On-chain data needs no key — Hyperliquid's public
API is unauthenticated.)

### Locking the bot to yourself (`ADMIN_CHAT_ID`)

Because the bot is public by default, anyone who finds it can use it. **If `ADMIN_CHAT_ID` is
present, the bot is only accessible to you — no one else.** Every command (`/start`, `/help`,
`/add`, …) and button tap from any other chat is silently ignored, and persisted watchlists
from other chats stop receiving notifications (their rows stay in the DB — removing the
variable makes the bot public again). Find your chat id by messaging the bot and running
`cargo run --bin hl-tracker-telegram-setup`, then:

```dotenv
# .env
ADMIN_CHAT_ID=123456789
```

To allow a few extra chats besides the admin, add them to `TRACKER_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS`
(comma-separated); the two combine.

## Run

The tracker is a Rust binary; docker is the intended deployment (the original Python
implementation still lives side by side — `uv run hl-tracker` — but the Rust port is what ships
and carries the current notification format):

```bash
make up                                 # docker: rebuild + start in the background
make logs                               # follow (notifications land here in log-only mode)
# or natively:
cargo run --release --bin hl-tracker    # a.k.a. make run-rs
```

Then, in Telegram, anyone can DM the bot and manage their own watchlist:

```
/add 0x6bea…597f Whale-1     follow a wallet (labelled)
/remove 0x6bea…597f          stop following
/rename 0x6bea…597f Whale     relabel
/list                        show the wallets you follow
/positions                   live open positions of a wallet you follow (tap to pick one)
```

`/positions` renders a terminal watchlist — largest position first, abbreviated money, and a
`TOT` footer with the wallet's net notional and net unrealized PnL:

```
📋 Whale-1 · 3 open
COIN  SIDE     VALUE    uPNL
BTC   L 10x  $128.2k  +$3.1k
ETH   S 5x    $64.4k   -$820
DOGE  L 3x     $9.6k    +$95
----------------------------
TOT   3 pos  $202.2k  +$2.4k
```

### Configuration (env vars, or a `.env` at the repo root)

| `TRACKER_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` | *(open to all)* | Comma-separated chat-id allowlist to make the bot private (combines with `ADMIN_CHAT_ID`) |
| `TRACKER_NOTIFY_REDUCE_CLOSE` | `true` | Notify on reduce/close (`false` = open+add only) |
| `TRACKER_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_S` | `45` | Leverage/drift reconcile cadence (`0` disables) |
| `TRACKER_RECONCILE_BATCH` | `20` | Wallets re-seeded per reconcile cycle |
| `TRACKER_SEED_CONCURRENCY` | `8` | Concurrency of the startup seed sweep |
| `TRACKER_LIVE_COINS` | *(all perps)* | Comma-separated coins to restrict the feed |
